# Building-Arima-Model

# Introduction
In time series analysis , autoregressive integrated moving average and seasonal ARIMA models are generalizations of the autoregressive moving average model to non-stationary series and periodic variation, respectively. All these models are fitted to time series in order to better understand it and predict future values.

ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, which is a statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It combines autoregressive and moving average components to predict future values based on past observations.
